## Product Vision Statement

SpendWise is a smart and intuitive expense-tracking app that empowers users to curb overspending and take control of their financial future.

## User Requirements

1. **Organized Expense Overview**  
   As a user who values efficiency, I want the app to automatically categorize my expenses and present a clear, structured overview so that I can easily grasp the current state of my spending.

2. **Timely Financial Notifications:**  
   As a user who needs timely information, I want to receive real-time notifications about my transactions to ensure safety and address any financial emergencies promptly, including quick access to a service hotline.

3. **Secure Investment Recommendations:**  
   As a user concerned about privacy, I want the app to offer secure, data-safe recommendations and connect me to trusted investment services so that I feel confident managing my money.

4. **Portfolio Optimization Tools:**  
   As a user aiming to combat inflation, I want timely updates from the app after it automatically checks for latest products that meets my need.

5. **Unified Expense Dashboard:**  
   As a user with multiple accounts, I want the app to compile all my expense data into one dashboard so that I can keep track of my overall spending easily.

6. **Consistent Expense Tracking:**  
   As a user who struggles with overspending, I want a simple and intuitive expense tracking system that consistently records my transactions and alarms me when I spend too aggressively so that I can monitor and adjust my spending habits.

7. **Savings Goal Management:**  
   As a user planning for the future, I want a feature that helps me set, track, and monitor savings goals so that I can effectively prepare for future financial needs.

8. **Automated Expense Entry:**  
   As a user who finds manual expense classification tedious, I want the app to streamline expense entry with automation and smart suggestions, ensuring accurate categorization without extra effort.

9. **Personalized Budgeting & Alerts:**  
   As a user focused on maintaining a budget, I want personalized budgeting tools with real-time alerts when I approach my spending limits, helping me stay on track and avoid overspending.

10. **Bill Payment Reminders:**  
    As a user prone to forgetting due dates (e.g. credit card, rent, electricity due dates), I want timely reminders for upcoming bills and recurring payments so that I can ensure timely payments and avoid late or extra fees.
